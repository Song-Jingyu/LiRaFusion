We group the configurations based on the detectors head we use.

<!-- FUTR3D head -->
## FUTR3D Head
We mainly conducted experiments with the FUTR3D head. For FUTR3D we use the default 10 class setting.

<!-- centerpoint head -->
## Centerpoint Head
We evaluated our model on the centerpoint with two different class settings. The default setting is to use 7 classes for consistency with EZFusion.

## TODO
- [ ] Consider remove all configs for baseline
- [ ] Test all the configs
